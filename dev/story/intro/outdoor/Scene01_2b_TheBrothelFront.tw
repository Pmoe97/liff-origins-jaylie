Soaking in rain and now shadowed by darkness, you approach the man. Your heels click quietly on the cobblestone as you draw near. Without so much as a crouch you look upon his immobile form, examining him.

	The man is human, that much is obvious. He has dark hair, which in its drenched state mixed with the darkness of the fallen night, you cannot tell if it's brown or black. He has a rather chiselled look and were it not for the performance you just witnessed from him, you might've even considered him attractive.

	A steady stream of blood flows from the fresh wound on his forehead. Its darkness is quickly washed away by thick, heavy raindrops falling freely upon his still form in rhythmic taps. The wound seems superficial enough, but he surely will feel it in the morning. 

	Remembering the metal object that acted as the man's undoing, you glance around him to see what exactly it was that the woman had thrown.

	After a moment you see it. You bend over at the waist and pick up an //unusually// small horseshoe. Suddenly a question dawns on you.
