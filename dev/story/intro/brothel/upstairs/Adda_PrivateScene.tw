The door to her private chamber closes with a decisive click behind you. The sound echoes in the stillness like a judgment passed. No music, no muffled laughter from the floor below—just the rich silence of a room that doesn’t often welcome guests.

Adda moves without hurry, shedding her outer shawl and draping it over a chaise as though undressing were a form of punctuation. Everything about the space feels deliberate. The scent of saffron and roses lingers in the warm air, catching in your throat.

She doesn’t look at you right away. Instead, she adjusts a lamp on the wall, softening the light until it pools golden across the silk-covered bed.

Then she turns. And that gaze of hers—steady, dark, faintly amused—lands on you like a touch.

<<speech "adda">>I'm not sure that you recognize quite how rare it is for someone to be standing here in the position you are in, young Lady. I have not taken anyone back here in quite some time.<</speech>>

Her voice is velvet wrapped around something sharper. It’s not a question. It’s a reminder.

<<speech "adda">>So. Shall I reward your diligence... or teach you what it *really* means to please a mistress?<</speech>>

She steps closer, slowly—never hurrying, never uncertain. One hand reaches out, gliding up your arm, fingertips dragging softly toward your neck. A test, maybe. Or a promise.

<<speech "adda">>Strip, darling. Slowly. I want to see if you can follow orders... before I give the ones that matter.<</speech>>
