Darian lies beside you, one arm behind his head, the other tracing slow, absent lines along your upper arm. His skin is cool, covered in a sweet sheen of sweat. You feel the rise and fall of his breath as it slowly steadies.

For a while, he just gazes up at the ceiling, silent. When he finally speaks, his voice is soft—mellowed by the moment.

<<speech "darian">>You know… I used to think there was nothing sweeter than holding a final note and hearing a crowd hold its breath.<</speech>>

He glances toward you, lips curling into a faint, crooked smile.

<<speech "darian">>That… might be the first thing to ever compete.<</speech>>

You smack his arm with a grin, laughing.

<<speech "jaylie">>Gods! How do you still have lame pickup lines <em>after</em>?<</speech>>

He rolls onto his side, brushing a knuckle along your collarbone—light as a sigh.

<<speech "darian">>You're right, that was terrible.<</speech>>

Your lips curl into a devilish smile as you lean in.

<<speech "jaylie">>Oh, so I was that bad, then?<</speech>>

His face flushes. The smile falters. He stammers an awkward apology. You burst out laughing as he bows his head in exaggerated defeat.

<<speech "darian">>Please, have mercy on me, woman. You do something to me—I lose my edge.<</speech>>

You're just about to reply when the world erupts.

A flash of white fills the room—brilliant, blinding, immediate. No delay. The explosion that follows shakes the walls and rattles the floor beneath you.

You feel it in your bones. The hair on your body stands on end. There's a sharp taste of metal on your tongue.

As the light fades, you blink rapidly, trying to clear your vision. You cross to the window, searching the street outside for answers.

Just down the road, a faint orange glow flickers.

At first, it looks like lamplight.

But then you realize the truth.
