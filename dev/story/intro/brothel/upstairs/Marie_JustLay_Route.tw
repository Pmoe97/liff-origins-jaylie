	<p>You lie on your side, facing her. Marie's hair spills over her pillow in soft, tangled waves. She watches you—not intensely, but openly, like she's studying something she never thought she'd have a chance to.</p>

	<p>You both say nothing for a while. Her fingertips trail small patterns on the quilt between you.</p>
