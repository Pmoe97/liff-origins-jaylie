	<p>Darian crosses the room and brushes the dust cover off a dark upright piano tucked into a curtained alcove. It looks worn but carefully maintained—like it's been waiting, not forgotten. He runs a hand across the keys once without pressing them, then sits.</p>

	<p>He doesn't look at you right away. He just closes his eyes and breathes in. Then his fingers begin to move.</p>

					<p>At first, it's only piano. A slow, minor melody that unfolds like candlelight—soft and flickering. The chords are melancholy but not sad. Reflective. Like something that remembers joy without claiming it.</p>

					<p>You close your eyes. The curtains absorb every echo. This isn't a performance. It's a confession.</p>

								<p>Then he begins to sing.</p>

								<blockquote>
								<i>“In halls of glass and violet dusk,</i><br>
								<i>I wandered once, and dared to trust.</i><br>
								<i>The silence watched, the shadows stayed—</i><br>
								<i>and yet I sang, though light decayed.”</i><br><br>

								<i>“My sister's laugh, my mother's grace,</i><br>
								<i>the echo lost in every place.</i><br>
								<i>I sing not now to be adored—</i><br>
								<i>I sing for ghosts I can't afford.”</i>
								</blockquote>

								<p>His voice is soft, low, haunting. Every note feels chosen. Earned. You don't move. You don't breathe too loudly. You just <em>listen</em>.</p>

											<p>The final note fades into silence. Darian lets his hands fall away from the keys slowly, like he's afraid the stillness will shatter if he moves too quickly.</p>

											<p>He looks at you—really looks at you. There's no performer left in him. Just a man who let go of something heavy and wants to know if it landed softly.</p>

											<<speech "darian">>That song's never had an audience before.<</speech>>

											<<speech "jaylie">>You should give it more often. If not to them... then to yourself.<</speech>>

											<p>He smiles, small but warm. His hand lingers near yours, not touching. Just close enough that you feel it.</p>
