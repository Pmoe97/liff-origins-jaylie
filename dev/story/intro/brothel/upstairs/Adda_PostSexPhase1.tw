Adda rises before you've even shifted. She moves with quiet finality, gathering her dark blue dress from its heap on the floor and pulling it up her body and onto her arms. The silky material falls against her skin like it never left.

You sit up slowly as she crosses to a low shelf tucked behind the bar. A ceramic teapot waits—still warm, still full. She pours a single cup, adds a measured spoon of honey, stirs without looking.

<<speech "adda">>Apologies if you were hoping to linger, but I have a business to run. Cuddling doesn't keep the lights on.<</speech>>

She says it without cruelty. Just truth. You watch the steam rise from her cup as she takes a sip and exhales—quiet, focused. Already in the next moment.

You begin to dress. She doesn't rush you, but she doesn't slow down either. The calm between you isn't intimate—it's professional. Familiar. Like two performers striking the final pose before the curtain falls.

When you're both ready, she moves to the inner door leading back to the parlor and opens it with a practiced flick of the wrist.

<<speech "adda">>Come. Let's not make the others wonder if I've decided to retire on a whim.<</speech>>

You follow her through the velvet curtain. The parlor is quieter now, low laughter and murmured voices brushing the candlelit air. She walks with purpose, already surveying the room, reading it like a ledger.

<<speech "jaylie">>You really do see everything that happens here, don't you?<</speech>>

<<speech "adda">>I have to. This house only works because someone's watching when the rest of the world blinks.<</speech>>

You're halfway across the floor when it happens.

Light. So bright it swallows everything—color, shape, thought. The room vanishes in a white roar. And then—

Sound. A thunderclap so close it doesn't crack—it detonates.

Glass behind the bar bursts. The floor lurches. Every guest in the room freezes.

Adda's head snaps toward the front curtain, her voice suddenly all business.

<<speech "adda">>That wasn't distant. Move.<</speech>>

You push forward with her, the curtain parting beneath your hands. At the brothel's entrance, the door rattles against its frame.

Through the windows, down the street—

A flicker of orange.

It grows. It dances.

It burns.
