Adda sits beside you on the edge of the low settee, one knee crossed over the other, her robe drawn closed but loose at the collar. A soft trail of steam curls from the teacup in her hand—when did she pour it? You didn’t hear.

She’s already composed. Back straight. Hair gathered. Breathing steady. As if nothing in this room has power over her anymore.

<<speech "adda">>Most who’ve shared this room with me left with more questions than answers.<</speech>>

She takes a sip, gaze drifting toward the bar beyond the curtain. Her voice is calm—almost absentminded—but the weight behind it lands all the same.

<<speech "adda">>You, though... I think you already understand that some things aren’t meant to be explained. Only witnessed.<</speech>>

You shift beside her, feeling the tension still unwinding in your body.

<<speech "jaylie">>Is that what I am, then? A witness?<</speech>>

Adda’s lips curve—just a little. Not quite a smile. More like a secret unfolding.

<<speech "adda">>Perhaps. Or perhaps you're just a rare moment of peace in a life that’s forgotten how to recognize it.<</speech>>

She doesn’t look at you when she says it.

But then she does. Her eyes find yours, and for a heartbeat, the whole room feels quiet enough to hear your pulse.

And then the sky ruptures.

The entire chamber floods with light—brilliant, white, wrong. Before thought can form, the blast of thunder hits like a fist in your chest. The floor trembles beneath you. The glassware behind the bar shatters with a sound like ice snapping in a furnace.

You taste metal. Your skin crawls.

Adda is already standing. Not startled—just ready. Her eyes are locked on the curtain.

<<speech "adda">>That was close. Too close.<</speech>>

She moves toward the outer door, pulling the velvet aside to peer into the parlor. You follow, breath still catching.

<<speech "adda">>There.<</speech>>

Down the lane, beyond the windows—an orange glow. Distant. Rising. Spreading.
