You step inside, and the first thing you notice is the quiet.

Not the absence of sound—but a kind of intentional stillness, like the room was waiting for you. The lighting is soft, coming from an old floor lamp with a tasseled shade that throws golden light across the space. No garish colors. No scent of perfume or smoke. Just wood polish, old books, and something faintly herbal.

The furniture is modest and well kept—an upright piano stands against one wall, its top dusted and adorned with a single framed photo turned inward. Beside it, a stack of music books, some well-worn, some pristine. One still bears a theater stamp from another city. Another life.

A velvet armchair sits near the bed, and atop it lies a folded overcoat and a small, flat tin. You recognize it immediately for what it is: a vocal tin, used by singers to keep their throat warm and clear.

There’s no mirror. No vanity. But on the wall above the bed hangs a tapestry—simple, woven, depicting a great lake beneath a starry sky. No name, no inscription. Just still water and distant light.

Darian closes the door behind you gently.

<<speech "darian">>It’s not much, but it’s mine. What I’ve held onto. What I’ve let go.<</speech>>

He steps past you and gestures to the bed with a soft smile.

<<speech "darian">>Make yourself comfortable. You’re safe here.<</speech>>
