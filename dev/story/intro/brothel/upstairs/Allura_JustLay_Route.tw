	<p>You settle in beside her, head finding a soft spot in the sea of cushions. Allura doesn't pull you close—she lets you come to her at your own pace. But her presence is magnetic, and soon your shoulders touch. Her tail coils near your leg, not quite brushing it.</p>

	<p>One of her hands finds your hair. She brushes it back, slow and rhythmic, untangling knots that weren't really there. You close your eyes to the sound of her gentle breathing and the soft hiss of rain outside the window.</p>
