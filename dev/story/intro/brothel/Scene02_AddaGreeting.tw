<<speech "adda">>You will have to forgive me for staring. If I didn't know any better I would have thought royalty had just walked into my humble parlor.<</speech>>

<<speech "adda">>My name is Adda. The locals call me Mistress Adda, or Madam Adda, and this is my establishment, The Nuzzling Noctail. I assure you we have anything that could suit the needs of…<</speech>>

	She looks you up and down, staring rather obviously at your hair, obviously recognizing its shade.

<<speech "adda">>...even the most discerning of clientele. May I ask what you'd like to be called, <em>young Lady?</em><</speech>>

You shuffle uncomfortably for a moment. Coming in here seemed like such a great moment only seconds ago and now you stand before Mistress Adda whom you feel unpacked your whole identity in mere seconds.

<<speech "jaylie">> I suppose Jaylie would be fine, right?<</speech>>

	You swear you'd never felt more unsure of yourself than you suddenly were in this exact moment.

<<speech "adda">> Not to worry, Jaylie. My hosts are all trained to uphold the utmost discretion, not that many of them are as observant as myself… <span class="whisper">your highness</span>.<</speech>>

You take a moment to catch your breath and find your tongue.

<<speech "jaylie">>Well thank you Madam Adda. I appreciate the hospitality and the discretion. Now if I may ask, what would one girl have to do to get a birthday drink for herself in your fine establishment? <</speech>>

<<speech "adda">>

<p>You follow Mistress Adda through a set of velvet red curtains and [[into the parlor|TheBrothelParlorOverview]].</p>
