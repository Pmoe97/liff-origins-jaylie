You approach the blonde girl, who had thrown the horseshoe at the man outside. She turns half a face towards you as you sit on the couch next to her. Her face is soft, but she is obviously annoyed.

<<speech "jaylie">>Do you mind if I sit here with you?<</speech>>

<<speech "marie">>I suppose you can. I'm not much in the mood to talk.<</speech>>

You take a seat next to her, your knees pointed away from her, making sure to give her space. She seems to stare at everything in the room but you.
