You drift toward the velvet chaise, where the blue-skinned woman is laying, drawn more by the stillness around it than the woman herself—at first.

Then her eyes find you. Golden, slitted like a cat's, and too calm for the room they're in.

She doesn't rise. She doesn't need to.

<<speech "allura">>You walk like someone hoping not to be noticed… and yet, here you are.<</speech>>

Her voice is warm and low, with an accent that paints every vowel like a slow drag of silk. She doesn't smile, exactly—but her lips curl at the edges, just enough to make you feel seen.

<<speech "jaylie">>Sorry, I just...<</speech>>

<<speech "allura">>Ah-ah.<</speech>> 

She lifts a finger, not to silence you, but to taste the moment. Her tail curls idly along the back of the couch.

<<speech "allura">>Let's not ruin it with apologies. Come. Sit. Lie, if you prefer.<</speech>>

You hesitate only long enough to feel foolish, then ease onto the edge of the chaise. The cushion dips beneath you, a hush of perfume and velvet rising around your skin.

<<speech "allura">>Mmm. Much better. Now… what name do I have the pleasure of toying with tonight?<</speech>>

<<speech "jaylie">>Jaylie.<</speech>>

<<speech "allura">>Jaylie.<em> Such a soft name. But there's something beneath it, I think. Something sharp.</em><</speech>>

She tilts her head and watches you like she's measuring shadows in candlelight.
<<know "allura">>
<<speech "allura">>You may call me Allura. For now.<</speech>>
