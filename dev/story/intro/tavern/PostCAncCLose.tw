Sarjan leans back with both arms wide, the clatter of the final dice still echoing as he rakes the pot toward himself with smug, meaty fingers.

<<speech "sarjan">>Better luck next time, sweetheart. If you’re lucky, I’ll even let you polish the pot before I win it again.<</speech>>

The two dice rats hoot like they’ve just witnessed divine comedy. One of them nearly chokes on his drink.

You exhale slowly. You lost, sure — but not by much. And you’ll be damned if Sarjan gets to strut away without at least one bruise to his pride.

<<speech "jaylie">>You know, Sarjan… it’s impressive, really. Takes a special kind of man to win a game of chance and still sound like he’s compensating.<</speech>>

The laughter cuts off like a blade through string.

Sarjan blinks.

<<speech "sarjan">>The fuck you just say to me?<</speech>>

<<speech "jaylie">>Oh, I’m sorry — did I use too many syllables? I meant: you’ve got the dice, but not the stones.<</speech>>

A sharp silence snaps through the table. Even the air feels tense, like the tavern itself is holding its breath.

Sarjan’s jaw tightens. His face goes crimson, mouth twisted in an ugly, wet sneer.

<<speech "sarjan">>That’s it, you little brat—<em>I’ll show you stones!</em><</speech>>
