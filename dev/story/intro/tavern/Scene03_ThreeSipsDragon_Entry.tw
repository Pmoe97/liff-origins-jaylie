You pull open the heavy oaken door and step inside. The wind whips at the precipice behind you but the warmth of the hearth greets you like the warm hug of a fellow, you instinctively lower your hood, water spilling down off of it.
Inside the Three Sips Dragon /* Thinking about having inline words you can hover over or click on to show little lore boxes like Alt-Text, entering a passage with one of these words will also add that information to the codex like a living and growing lore-book */, the air is thick with smoke, laughter, and the scent of hearth-brewed ale. Lanterns swing slightly overhead, their flickering light dancing across polished wood beams and walls darkened with age and spilled stories. The tavern's heart—a great firepit sunk into the floor—crackles merrily near the center of the room, casting long shadows that play on the faces of patrons scattered throughout.
A few eyes drift toward you, but none linger. Bastion is full of cloaked figures in rain-soaked hoods. No one spares much mind for another.
Except one.
<<speech "randompatron1">> "<strong>Close the damn door</strong>, you're lettin' the warm out, girl!" <</speech>>
Someone near the hearth waves a half-eaten leg of something at you without even turning. A few chuckles follow.
Heeding his words, you reach behind you and close the door, and just like that you are absorbed into the room.
To your right, the bar stretches across the far wall, worn smooth by time and elbows. Behind it, a man, tall and thick as a tree trunk, polishes a glass that doesn't seem to need polishing. His head is a shining dome, rich with wrinkled skin, his face, nestled atop a thick dark beard, is etched with long years and longer nights, but his eyes—piercing and pale blue—fix on you the moment you lower your hood.
He does little to acknowledge your existence aside from a half-hearted glance, barely longer than a blink.
[[You look around at the rest of the room.|Scene03_TheSpace]]
