You slide into the now-empty chair. The other three players are already grinning like cats who’ve cornered a crippled mouse. Dice clatter between them—worn bone cubes inked with strange symbols and dark smudges that might be blood, or just years of spilled drink.

<<speech "sarjan">>Right then. Pay attention, Red. I’m not explainin’ this twice.<</speech>>

<<speech "diceratone">>That's right tell er' Sarjan!<</speech>><<know "sarjan">>

Sarjan looks at the man who spoke with a stern scowl. Swiftly he reaches across the table and slaps the dice-rat across the ear.

<<speech "sarjan">>If you wouldn't fucking interrupt me, I'd a been explainin' it to er' already.<</speech>>

The second yes-man chuckles. The firs just leans in, holding his ear, looking sorry.

<<speech "sarjan">>This here's Crown and Caste. Four players, three dice each, the <strong>Caste dice</strong>, and three shared dice in the middle, the <strong>Crown dice</strong> Your goal? Lock the best damn combonation you can in three turns. There's bout fifteen combonations or so, but most of them are self-explanatory.<</speech>>

He lifts a dice cup and shakes it once for show. The sound is oddly threatening.

<<speech "sarjan">>We take turns rollin’. Each roll, you can lock in dice— if ye' don't they are rerolled on the next turn. But once you lock 'em, they stay. No backsies.<</speech>>

<<speech "dicerattwo">>And you’ve only got three rolls total—unless you burn a Control Chip to cheat fate.<</speech>>

<<speech "diceratone">>Or to fuck yourself over more efficiently. Depends how clever you are.<</speech>>

Sarjan flashes a grin like a rusted dagger.

<<speech "sarjan">>Scoring's simple if your brain ain't mush. Straights, groups of the same number, groups of pairs... Highest score wins the round, gets the pot. Second highest? Don't fucking matter none, if you ain't first yer last.<</speech>>

<<speech "sarjan">>Lose all your coin, and you're out.<</speech>>

The dice rattle again. Sarjan slides the pot to the center of the table.

<<speech "sarjan">>Alright, Jaylie. Let's see if you’ve got more than hot air behind that smirk.<</speech>>
