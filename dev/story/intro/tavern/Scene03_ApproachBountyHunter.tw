The man in the corner doesn’t look up as you approach—not at first. He continues dragging a whetstone down the edge of his dagger in slow, practiced strokes. His cloak is pulled back just enough to reveal a polished leather chestplate too clean to have seen real battle. The dark, tailored armor gleams faintly in the firelight, stitched with crimson threading that looks more decorative than durable.

Atop his head sits a wide-brimmed hat—deep gray, too dramatic for this tavern by half—plumed with a long, vividly colored feather that arcs like a banner. Everything about him is curated. Styled. Flashy. From the glint of his rings to the way his boots rest just-so, crossed at the ankle.

Eventually, he speaks—low, smooth, like a man who assumes you came here on purpose.
