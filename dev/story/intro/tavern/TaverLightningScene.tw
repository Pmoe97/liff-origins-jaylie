:: TavernLightningScene

A flash.
White, searing, god-sent.

It splits the sky—and the tavern—down the spine. The thunder follows instantly, as if the world itself forgot to blink.

The Noctail shrieks from the rafters, flailing into a tangle of limbs and panicked wings. It slams against the floorboards, scrabbling under tables as tankards crash and patrons shout in stunned confusion.

The air turns electric, thick with ozone. You taste metal.
Your teeth buzz. Your ears ring with a high, cruel whine that drowns out the world.

The foundation of the Three Sips Dragon shudders, beams groaning in protest. Dust and plaster rain from the ceiling.

All of it—
The noise, the light, the vertigo—
Lasts less than a heartbeat.

But in that moment, it feels as though time refused to move forward.

It lingers.

Burns into your vision.

Stays behind your eyes.

After a moment you blink the brightness away. The world returns to you. 

Tesska moved from behind you at some point and now stands near a large window at the front of the room. She looks out onto the street.

You quickly walk up next to her, matching your gaze with her's.

Far down the street, you see a flickering orange glow. At first, it seems like lantern light. Then it brightens—flares—and the realization hits like a punch to the gut.
