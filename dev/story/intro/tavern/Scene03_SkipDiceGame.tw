You fold your arms and cock your head, giving the man at the table the kind of look normally reserved for roaches in breadboxes.

<<speech "jaylie">>I think I’d rather scrub the floor with my tongue than sit next to you.<</speech>>

The table goes still.

The boisterous man blinks—just once. Then the grin drains from his face like bad beer through a split mug.

<<speech "sarjan">>Oi, what’d you say to me?<</speech>>

His cronies glance at each other, not sure whether to laugh or duck. Sarjan shoves back from the table, rising to full height—narrow, twitchy, all brittle swagger and wounded pride.

<<speech "sarjan">>I was tryin’ to be friendly, you cocky little twat. Should’ve known a mouth like yours came without a brain to slow it down.<</speech>>

You smile, razor-thin.

<<speech "jaylie">>Then I guess we both learned something tonight.<</speech>>

Chairs scrape. A tankard hits the floor. One of the cronies mutters “Shit...” just as Sarjan lunges.
