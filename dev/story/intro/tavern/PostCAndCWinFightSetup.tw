The final die clatters to a stop. A perfect lineup. Your hand barely touches the table before Sarjan slams his fist down, scattering chips and curses alike.

<<speech "jaylie">>Huh. Would you look at that.<</speech>>

You stretch lazily, letting the silence thicken. Then you grin — all teeth and satisfaction — and rake the pot toward your side of the table.

<<speech "jaylie">>Some beginner's luck, huh?.<</speech>>

The dice rats fall silent. One of them lets out a stifled snort that he tries to smother in his drink. The other looks like he just bit his own tongue.

Sarjan’s face twists. His nostrils flare, his knuckles whiten, and for a heartbeat it looks like he’s chewing on nails instead of words.

<<speech "sarjan">>You little—<em>slitch</em>.<</speech>>

He stands so fast his chair topples backwards, hitting the tavern floor with a dull crack.

<<speech "sarjan">>You think you're clever, is that it?!<</speech>>

The air shifts. The nearby chatter dies off. The dice rats scoot back from the table, suddenly very interested in the far corners of the room.

<<speech "jaylie">>What's the matter? Can't take a little loss without flipping the table?<</speech>>

Sarjan’s hand twitches toward his belt — not quite drawing anything, but close enough to set your pulse humming.

<<speech "sarjan">>I’ll show you what losing feels like.<</speech>>
