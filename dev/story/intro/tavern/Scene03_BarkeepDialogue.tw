You decide to approach the bar and finally get your drink. As you approach, movement in the rafters catches your attention. You turn your gaze upward.

An orange-spotted noctail, which you hadn’t noticed before, extends its rear into the air, pulling itself into a long, satisfying stretch. You watch for a moment as the feline finishes stretching and effortlessly bounds across the width of the room to a rafter on the opposite side, nearly thirty feet away. Despite the commonality of noctails in the city, their grace always amazes you.

You reach the bar and take a seat on a thick, heavy stool. Scooting closer, you settle your elbows onto the polished wood.

The barman steps forward and leans heavily onto the bar in front of you, resting his bulk onto hands as wide as battleaxes.

His words, though jumbled, are slow and methodical. Rolling from his mouth like molasses from a mountain.
