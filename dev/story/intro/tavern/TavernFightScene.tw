:: TavernFightScene

The table explodes as Sarjan shoves it aside, dice, coins, and drinks scatter like startled birds. He lunges—red-faced, snarling, swinging for your head.

He doesn’t get close.

A flash of motion—something huge moving between you—and suddenly you’re <em>falling</em> backward. A firm hand pushes you clear, and you're caught in a pair of arms that smell faintly of citrus and sweat.

<<speech "tesska">>Oof—gotcha, sweetheart.<</speech>>

Tesska holds your weight from behind like it is nothing to her. You turn your head and see her face—intimately close—she bites her lip looking towards her husband.

<<speech "tesska">>Watch this, girl. It's always my favorite when the big guy gets worked up.<</speech>>

Tesska's words ooze with a sexual tension that leads you to not doubt that what she said was true. You turn back towards Harroc.

Sarjan, after being pushed away from you took a moment to recalibrate. He looks at Harroc, the new object of his rage. He swings wildly. Harroc catches the hook with absolutely zero effort. You see Harroc's grip tighten and a quick series of pops eminate from Sarjan's now likely broken hand.

With another twist of his arm, and a shove, Sarjan is launched towards the main entrance of the tavern. Harroc with his free hands grabs the other two dice-rats. The skinny one by his ear, the same one Sarjan had slapped not so long ago; the fat one by his collar. Harroc moves with purpose, it's like watching a wild bear claiming its territory.

The two henchies in tow, Harroc approaches Sarjan once more before giving a powerful kick to his chest sending the drunkard soaring through the door. The sound of the heavy rain suddenly fills the tavern, and as if Harroc himself summoned it, a crack of thunder booms from somewhere in the distance. The men vanish into the downpour for only a moment. 

Harroc enters again, only slightly wet, as if the rain itself wasn't going to fuck with him tonight. His facial expression blank, untelling.

<<speech "tesska">><em>Isn't he incredible?</em><</speech>>

You don't have time to answer before Harroc walks up to you and in his slow methodical boom of a voice says

<<speech "harroc">>'Get that you’ve got something to prove. Just don’t do it in Tesska's bar.<</speech>>

His tone does not leave room for a proper response. You swallow hard, realizing you'd been holding your breath.

You nod at him. 

Tesska stands you back up properly. Harroc moves back to his spot behind the bar, as if nothing had happened.
