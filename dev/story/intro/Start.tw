# Introduction

Hello there and welcome to Liff Origins: Jaylie. This is my first game-development project and an introduction to the World of Liff, a fantasy world all my own where this small prequel and my planned future project, Adventures of Liff,  will take place.

In this story you play from the perspective of //Jaylie Primmon//, the Princess and heir to the throne of the Kingdom of Bastion. 

This story will contain elements of an ''ADULT/MATURE'' nature. Content like this is typically prohibited by law to be consumed by non-adults (18-21 in most places). By continuing with this story you confirm that you are legally allowed to consume this type of content wherever you are.
