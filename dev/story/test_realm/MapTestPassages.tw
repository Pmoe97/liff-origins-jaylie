:: KingsStreet3
You stand in the heart of King's Street, the main thoroughfare of the district. The cobblestone street bustles with merchants, travelers, and locals going about their daily business. 

To the north, you can see the street continuing toward the upper district. To the south, it leads toward the palace gates. East takes you toward the merchant quarter, while west leads to a quieter residential area.

The Three Sips Dragon Tavern's sign creaks in the breeze to the northeast, and you can smell the aroma of roasted meat and ale drifting from its direction.

:: ThreeSipsDragonTavern
You push through the heavy wooden doors of the Three Sips Dragon Tavern. The interior is warm and inviting, filled with the chatter of patrons and the clinking of tankards. A large fireplace crackles in the corner, casting dancing shadows on the walls.

The tavern keeper, a burly man with a graying beard, nods at you from behind the bar. Several locals sit at various tables, some engaged in animated conversations, others quietly nursing their drinks.

A bard in the corner strums a lute, singing tales of distant lands and heroic adventures.

Behind the counter stands an elderly woman with silver hair and keen eyes. She looks up from grinding some herbs and smiles at you.

:: PalaceGate
You stand before the imposing gates of the royal palace. Tall iron bars topped with golden spikes stretch high above you, and beyond them you can see manicured gardens and the palace's magnificent architecture.

Two guards in polished armor stand at attention on either side of the gate. Their eyes follow your movements, but they remain silent and professional.

A brass plaque near the gate reads: "Royal Palace of Bastion - Authorized Personnel Only"

<<if State.variables.player && State.variables.player.reputation && State.variables.player.reputation.royal >= 10>>
	The guards recognize your standing with the royal court and nod respectfully.
	
	[[Enter the palace->PalaceEntrance]]
<<else>>
	The guards eye you carefully. It's clear that you would need significant reputation with the royal court to gain entry here.

:: CityGate
You reach the eastern gate of the city, a massive stone archway that serves as one of the main entrances to the district. Guards check the papers of travelers coming and going, while merchants with loaded carts wait in line to have their goods inspected.

Beyond the gate, you can see the road stretching into the distance, leading to other parts of the kingdom. The countryside looks peaceful, with rolling hills and scattered farmsteads visible in the distance.

A notice board near the gate displays various announcements: job postings, wanted posters, and news from other settlements.
