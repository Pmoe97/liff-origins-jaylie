You stand in front of the Orphanage of Palms.  <<loadmap "orphanage_fire_1F">>

The building has a pillar of black smoke melding with the night sky above. Despite the heavy rain, the upper floor of the building is engulfed in flames. <div>
</div><div>The front door to orphanage stands open, swinging in the gusty winds of the storm. Wisps of dark smoke creep out from the top of the door frame, carried away by the wind.

Somewhere inside.... A young boy is all on his own.</div>
