  <<speech "jaylie">>Could I get a drink, please?<</speech>>

  Harroc pauses mid-wipe on a tankard, eyes sliding to meet yours without turning his head. His voice is steady, low.

  <<speech "harroc">>You could. But that didn't sound like someone who *wants* a drink. Try again.<</speech>>

  You blink. He doesn't look angry—just expectant. Testing.

  <<speech "jaylie">>...Alright. I want a drink. Something strong. Something that proves I'm not just a girl in a dress, out past her bedtime.<</speech>>

  That gets the faintest grunt of approval. He sets the mug down and turns away to pour.

  <<speech "harroc">>Better.<</speech>>

  He slides a dark, frothy brew toward you. The mug is heavy, the liquid inside smelling faintly of burnt caramel and black pepper.

  <<speech "harroc">>Locals call it Emberjaw. Kicks harder than it starts. Like most things worth finishing.<</speech>>

  You take a sip—it hits your tongue smooth, then sears your throat with a trailing warmth. You try not to cough.

  <<speech "jaylie">>That's... intense.<</speech>>

  <<speech "harroc">>That's the idea.<</speech>>

  <<speech "jaylie">>Has it always been this quiet in here?<</speech>>

  <<speech "harroc">>No.<</speech>>

  He doesn't elaborate. Just goes back to wiping the rim of a thick mug, gaze drifting over the room without much interest.

  You wait a beat. Then try again.

  <<speech "jaylie">>Is it just... one of those nights, or is something going on?<</speech>>

  Harroc finally shrugs. Not dismissive—just honest.

  <<speech "harroc">>Fair starts tomorrow. Most folk are home, saving coin or nursing livers. Fewer fights that way. Easier cleanup.<</speech>>

  He sets the mug down and grabs another without looking at you.

  <<speech "harroc">>Two nights from now, this place'll smell like sweat, cheap wine, and regret. Tonight's just the pause.<</speech>>

  A log pops loudly in the hearth behind you. He doesn't react.

<<append "#convoBox">>

  <<speech "jaylie">>Do you have a food menu, or is it just drinks?<</speech>>

  Harroc doesn't stop what he's doing—just gestures with a thick thumb toward a chalkboard hung crooked on the wall behind him.

  <<speech "harroc">>Menu's there. Three kinds of stew. Bread if it's not gone. Couple of pickled things in jars. Mostly drinks though.<</speech>>

  He grabs a bottle, uncorks it, sniffs it, and nods to himself.

  <<speech "harroc">>People don't come here for variety. They come because it stays open, and I don't water anything down.<</speech>>

<<append "#convoBox">>

  <<speech "jaylie">>Aside from the fair, you heard about anything interesting lately?<</speech>>

  Harroc doesn't look up, just sets a clean mug down on the bar with a dull *clunk*.  

  <<speech "harroc">>Aside from the usual bounty-hunter and underworld nonsense, the city's been quiet. Think either everything's going fine, which it's usual not, or the city is just holding its breath waiting for something to happen.<</speech>>

  You give him an eyebrow.

  <<speech "jaylie">>What do you mean about the underworld nonsense.<</speech>>

  Harroc finally looks up at you, as serious as you have seen him tonight.

  <<speech "harroc">>Don't you go worrying about that, not something you should muddy yer' boots with.<</speech>>  

  His tone seems final, and you decide not to press the issue. The criminal element in Bastion is something you always knew existed, but no matter who you ask, you never manage to learn much about it.

  He picks up another mug. Starts wiping again.  

  <<speech "jaylie">>What about the bounty hunter stuff?<</speech>>

  He doesn't quite sigh so much as deflate a little.

  <<speech "harroc">>Want to know about that? Talk to the fella in the corner over there. Think he's with the guild.<</speech>>

  He moves onto the next mug with his rag.

  <<speech "harroc">>Somethin' else, girl?<</speech>>

You offer Harroc a small nod. 

<<speech "jaylie">>I'll let you get back to it.<</speech>>

He grunts in acknowledgment, still polishing the same mug with practiced, absent motions. The clink of glass and quiet murmur of voices fills the space as you turn away.

[[You walk back towards the main area of the tavern.|Scene03_TheSpace]]
