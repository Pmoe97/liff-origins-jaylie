<<speech "jaylie">>Were you watching me?<</speech>>

<<speech "allura">><em>Of course I was.</em><</speech>>

She says it like it costs her nothing. No hesitation. No apology. Her tail flicks lazily behind her again, curling in a figure eight.

<<speech "allura">>Like I said before, you walked in like you didn’t want anyone to notice, which only made it harder not to. And then... you looked at me like you were hoping I’d notice anyway. I do not know how you expected me not to stare. It was the most entertaining thing I have seen all night.<</speech>>

You open your mouth, caught somewhere between denial and deflection, but she doesn’t give you room to find either.

<<speech "allura">><em>It’s sweet, you know. The way your eyes try not to linger. The way you sit just far enough away to lie about your curiosity. Please go on and look all you want. I would not have dressed like this if I did not welcome it. I like how your gaze feels on my skin.</em><</speech>>

She leans in just enough to make your pulse catch, but not so much that you could call her out for it. Her eyes are impossibly gold this close—like molten metal poured into a feline frame.

<<speech "jaylie">>You’re very confident. I mean that in a good way of course.<</speech>>

<<speech "allura">>Mm. That’s part of the fun. Most people want to be seen. They just don’t know how to ask for it.<</speech>>

She lifts her glass—something crimson and jeweled with condensation—and takes a sip without ever breaking eye contact. Then she tilts her head, just slightly.

<<speech "allura">>So, Jaylie... now that I've seen you, what will you show me next?<</speech>>

<<widget "Allura_OutOfPlace">>
<<append "#convoBox">>

<<speech "jaylie">>Don’t take this the wrong way, but... you feel kind of out of place here.<</speech>>

Allura freezes — dramatically, like a courtesan in a stage play. Her head tilts, her lips part slightly, and she places a hand to her chest with faux offense.

<<speech "allura">>Out of place? You wound me, <em>petite</em>.<</speech>>

She gives an exaggerated sigh, then lets her hand slide down to rest at her hip. Her smile returns, but it’s sharper now — teasing, dangerous.

<<speech "allura">>Here I thought I was the very portrait of hospitality. My tail’s behaving, my cleavage is curated, my drink is full — and yet somehow, I am a misfit in my own chaise lounge.<</speech>>

<<speech "jaylie">>No, I didn’t mean— I just meant that… I don’t get it. You’re stunning. Charismatic. You look like someone who should be draped in silks, surrounded by admirers. I guess I was surprised to find you alone.<</speech>>

Allura’s eyes narrow slightly, the mockery fading just a hair — enough to let something thoughtful flicker underneath.

<<speech "allura">>Ah. So what you’re saying is... I look like I should come with an entourage. A pedestal. A personal fan brigade?<</speech>>

<<speech "jaylie">>I mean... yes? But in a nice way.<</speech>>

Allura chuckles — a low, velvety sound. She sips her drink again and lets a moment pass before responding.

<<speech "allura">>You’re not wrong, mon trésor. I’ve had those nights. But not all attention is desirable. And not every pedestal is worth standing on. Sometimes it’s more fun to pick someone <em>specific</em> to make the effort.<</speech>>

Her tail flicks again, brushing your calf this time — slower, more deliberate.

<<speech "allura">>And tonight, I think I like being the mystery in the corner. The one worth crossing the room for. After all, it worked, no?<</speech>>

You cannot even begin to argue with the logic. You look down and your hands in your lap and laugh to yourself for a moment. Then you look up at Allura. She stares at you. Her lips curling. Then together you both laugh louder, more heartily. It is the first time, you notice, that you have seen a truly revealing response from her. 

<<speech "jaylie">> You got me. <</speech>>

:: Allura_Phase0_Enjoyment [widget]
<<widget "Allura_Phase0_Enjoyment">>
<<append "#convoBox">>

<<speech "jaylie">>Can I ask you something real?<</speech>>

Allura arches a brow — the expression almost amused, but there's a flicker of something sharper beneath it. Caution, maybe. Or curiosity.

<<speech "allura">>You just did, mon cœur. But go on. I’m listening.<</speech>>

<<speech "jaylie">>Do you actually enjoy this? I mean... not the show. Not the act. But the being here. Talking like this. Connecting with someone.<</speech>>

The question lingers between you, heavier than the rest. For the first time, Allura doesn’t immediately answer. She swirls her drink slowly, eyes focused on the glass like the answer might settle at the bottom.

<<speech "allura">>You know what most people ask me?<</speech>>

She doesn’t wait for you to guess.

<<speech "allura">>They ask me what I charge. What I like. What I’ll do and what I won’t. You’re the first person tonight who’s asked if I <em>want</em> to be here.<</speech>>

She exhales slowly through her nose and leans back against the cushions, her posture more relaxed than before — not staged, not seductive. Just tired. Honest.

<<speech "allura">>The truth is… some nights, yes. I like the games. The theater of it all. There’s power in being seen — in choosing how to be seen. But then there are nights where I feel like a painting left in the rain. Pretty from a distance, but bleeding underneath.<</speech>>

Her voice never cracks. It doesn’t need to. You hear the weight behind every syllable.

<<speech "allura">>But talking like this? With you? That part I enjoy.<</speech>>

She sets her glass down, empty now, and folds her hands neatly in her lap.

<<speech "allura">>Ask me another one like that, and I might even answer it honestly.<</speech>>

<<speech "jaylie">>If there was anything I could do — right now — to truly make the rest of your night… what would it be?<</speech>>

Allura blinks.

Just once.

You catch the faintest hitch in her breath — like a stage performer who’s forgotten her next line.

<<speech "allura">>Now that...<em>that’s</em> a dangerous question.</speech>>

She says it quietly, almost to herself. No teasing, no act — not yet. She leans forward just a touch, like gravity’s decided she should be closer to you now.

<<speech "allura">>You’d be surprised how few people ask that with any intention behind it. Most of them want a specific answer. One they can anticipate. One that makes them feel clever for guessing right.<</speech>>

Her tail doesn’t flick this time. It curls gently around one ankle, like a ribbon tied in thought.

<<speech "allura">>But you…</speech>

She lifts her eyes to meet yours, and for a moment, the room feels quieter. As if everything’s paused to hear her answer too.

<<speech "allura">>If you mean it — if this isn’t just another performance…?</speech>

She smiles softly. Not like before. No hunger in it. Just something warm and fragile.

<<speech "allura">>Then maybe you’ve already done it. You asked the question.<</speech>>

You feel a strange mix of pride and disappointment, as if you were upset that she didn't ask you to go fight the lightning outside—which but in this moment—something is making you feel like you could have done it.

:: Allura_DrinkOrder [widget]
<<widget "Allura_DrinkOrder">>
<<append "#convoBox">>

<<speech "jaylie">>Would you mind ordering a drink for me?<</speech>>

Allura raises an eyebrow, her smile curling at the edges like parchment near flame.

<<speech "allura">>Mmm. Dangerous thing to offer a woman like me that much power, <em>chérie</em>.<</speech>>

She turns slightly, catching Bert’s eye across the room with a subtle flick of her fingers and a tilt of her chin.

<<speech "allura">>Bert, love — something slow and seductive, but with a little teeth. Like me.<</speech>>

<<speech "bert">>Comin’ right up, madame.<</speech>>

Moments later, a pale violet drink arrives in a crystal glass shaped like a blooming flower. The scent hits first—berries, wine, and something herbal beneath it.

<<speech "allura">>We call this one <em>Velvet Mercy</em>. Tastes like a favor you didn’t earn. Be careful with it.<</speech>>

You lift the glass and sip. It's sweet, rich, and ends with a bitter curl that coils at the back of your throat like smoke.

<<speech "jaylie">>That’s... complex.<</speech>>

<<speech "allura">>Aren’t we all?<</speech>>

<<speech "jaylie">>Hey do you have maybe like a private room we could go to? We don't have to like... <stong>DO</strong> anything, I just wanted to get to know you more.<</speech>>

Allura's eyes shine and glow. She feigns emotional damage again, this time less dramatic.

<<speech "allura">>So you want to do nothing with me? <em>Mon trésor.</em> Here I was thinking my charms were working on you.<</speech>>

You blush but don't get a chance to respond before she begins to stand. Her tail brushes down your leg like it has a mind of its own before she gathers to her feet.

<<speech "allura">><em>Viens.</em> Come then. Let’s see if the air upstairs is any quieter.<</speech>>

<<speech "jaylie">>We can talk more later.<</speech>>

Allura stretches languidly on the chaise, her body language equal parts feline and flame.

<<speech "allura">>Of course, <em>petite</em>. I’ll still be here — spinning webs and sipping slow poison.<</speech>>

She raises her glass slightly toward you.

<<speech "allura">>Don’t stay gone too long, hmm? I find myself... growing fond.<</speech>>
