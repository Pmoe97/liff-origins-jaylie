  <<speech "jaylie">>You seem very sure of yourself.<</speech>>

  Allura leans forward, the golden light of a nearby candle casting serpentine shadows along her cheekbones. Her lips curve into a slow, knowing smile.

  <<speech "allura">>Ah, but confidence is only dangerous if it’s misplaced, no?<</speech>>

  <<speech "jaylie">>What brings someone like you to a place like this?<</speech>>

  A low laugh escapes her, like silk brushing skin. She shifts in her seat, the faint rustle of lace and perfume brushing the air between you.

  <<speech "allura">>Oh, darling. You say that like this place does not deserve me. I am here because I choose to be... and because there are always mouths to tempt and hearts to twist.<</speech>>

  <<speech "jaylie">>What would you do with someone like me? I mean like if we went somewhere more private?<</speech>>

  She slowly traces the rim of her glass with one crimson-painted nail, eyes half-lidded.

  <<speech "allura">>Mm... I would unwrap you slowly, like a forbidden letter... and read *every line* until your ink runs dry.<</speech>>

  Your breath catches in your throat, and your cheeks flush with heat. 

  <<speech "jaylie">>Wow.. Uh- Well. You don't have a shy bone in your body, do you?<</speech>>

  <<speech "allura">>Oh, mon trésor, you are welcome to inspect my body any time you'd like and if you find such a thing, I assure you we will excise it together.<</speech>>

  <<speech "jaylie">>Do you think you could help me get a drink?<</speech>>

  She raises a single finger, summoning Bert without looking. Rain lightly patters against the windowpane behind her.

  <<speech "allura">>Of course, chérie. Bert? Something dark, sinful, and just a little sweet. Like *her.*<</speech>>

  <<speech "bert">>Here you are, ladies. A <em>Black Hole</em>. Enjoy.<</speech>>

  She lifts the drink and breathes in deeply before sipping, her expression momentarily softened.

  <<speech "allura">>Mmmmmmm... Ze black cherries in this are divine. You must try it, mon trésor.<</speech>>

  <<speech "jaylie">>Gods! Wow. That is delectable.<</speech>>
  
  Allura smiles at you over the rim of her own glass, her eyes glinting in the firelight. Clearly, she is quite pleased with herself.

  A distant thunder roll rumbles faintly through the walls. Allura tilts her head, considering you like a puzzle she already enjoys solving.

  <<speech "allura">>Do you now? Be careful, sweetling... the deeper you go, the more you will find yourself reflected in me.<</speech>>

    <<speech "jaylie">>Do you think we could go somewhere more private? The incense smoke is making me dizzy.<</speech>>

    A curling smile grows across Allura's lips.

    <<speech "allura">>Oh, mon chéri, the smoke unfortunately persists even upstairs. But if the prying eyes and lack of privacy are what bother you, I can help with that. Come. Follow me.<</speech>>

    With grace like a noctail, and the confidence of a dancer, Allura swings her feet to the floor and slowly rises. Every movement is deliberate. You can't help but stare at her curves as she moves in the dim light.
  
    She beckons your with a finger. You stand and follow her like a dog on a leash.

    <<speech "allura">>Oh noooo, going so soon? Come back to me when you're ready to play. You know where to find me. No need to beg.<</speech>>
  
    You stand from the velvet chaise. Allura's tail flicks playfully against the leg of your pants as you walk away.
