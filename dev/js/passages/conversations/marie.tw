    <<speech "marie">>I'm sorry, Jaylie. That's not who I am. That man just really brought the worst out of me. Think we can start again?<</speech>>

    You hesitate for a brief moment, then smile and nod at her. She gently pulls your hand, guiding you back to the couch.

    <<speech "marie">>Thank you for trying to check on me.<</speech>>

    She smiles. It looks a little forced, but you can tell she is genuinely trying.

    <<speech "marie">>I'm sorry. This isn't how I normally am. It's just been... a night. But I'd like to start over, if you don't mind.<</speech>>

  <<speech "jaylie">>Have you ever lived or traveled outside the city?<</speech>>

  Marie's expression lights up and she genuinely smiles for a moment. 

  <<speech "marie">>I was born in Albcorr, actually. I don't remember it very well. My family moved here when I was very little. Sometimes I have dreams though... I think they are memories. The tall trees. The green fields. The open sky, not choked with chimney smoke.<</speech>>

  Her smile fades a little, but you can still tell she is thinking about it fondly.

  <<speech "marie">>I've saved my coin for years. I want to go back one day. I want to see the trees. I want to <strong>CLIMB</strong> one. I want to sleep out in the fields covered only by a blanket of stars. Go so far away from the city that the only voice I would ever have to hear is my own... or maybe a friend's<</speech>>

  She glances at you, and smiles warmly.

  <<speech "jaylie">>Well, all you had to do was ask. Let's go now!<</speech>>

  <<speech "marie">>Oh, sure let's go, my bags are packed!<</speech>>

  As if waiting for this, lightning strikes somewhere in the distance, thunder lightly rumbles the building. Crystal and glass chime and tink for a moment.

  You and marie look at each other with straight faces, the burst into simultaneous laughter.

  <<speech "jaylie">>Okay maybe not tonight. But I could be the friend one day.<</speech>>

  Marie scrunches her shoulder to her chin and gives you a playful look.

  <<speech "marie">> You promise, friend?<</speech>>

  You both laugh again.

  <<speech "marie">>Oh definitely! I love the fair. I don't have to work the mornings, so I will spend most of my time looking at all the foreign jewellry and animals most likely. Then if I am lucky, maybe I'll meet some hunky foreigner for the evening.<</speech>>

  You both laugh at the thought.

  <<speech "jaylie">>I hope they treat you like a queen for the day.<</speech>>

  <<speech "marie">>How about you? Will you be in attendence tomorrow?<</speech>>

  Your face falls a bit. The question was fair play, and still somehow catches you off guard. Summoning thoughts of your mom.

  <<speech "jaylie">>The fair is always a little hard for me. Reminds me a lot of my mom. She died right around this time of year... When I was born actually.<</speech>>

  <<speech "marie">>Oh I am sorry to hear that. So you never got to know her?<</speech>>

  <<speech "jaylie">>Well not for a long time. But around the time I was about eight my dad started telling me more stories about her. She was the best type of person to exist. She was a healer. Dedicated her life to helping others.<</speech>>

  You frown a little. A tear wells in the corner of your eye. Marie notices and reaches out, wiping it away with her thumb. She cups your cheek and just smiles. You reach up and grab her hand, wrapping her fingers in yours and pulling it down to your lap. 

  <<speech "jaylie">>It was nice being able to learn about who she was, but sometimes it was still hard, because then I always felt like I had to live up to her standards. I'm afraid I could live a hundred lifetimes though and never be half the woman she was.<</speech>>

  <<speech "marie">>Well if it's any consolation, you are making my night better. You couldn't be all bad.<</speech>>

  You laugh a little, a short hearty chuckle. You trase trace her knuckle with your thumb.

  <<speech "jaylie">>You're not so bad yourself.<</speech>>

  She lets out a sharp chuckle and slaps your hand lightly.

  <<speech "marie">>Oh I know I'm a right bitch sometimes. But I do try to be a good person.<</speech>>

    You and Marie stand from your velvet couch and she takes you by the hand, leading you through the parlor, back towards the entrance. You pass through the heavy velvet curtain and make your way up the stairs. The air thickens even more with the smell of incense and perfume as you ascend.

    At the top of the stairs, Marie leads you down a long, narrow hallway before stopping at a non-descript door. She opens it and gestures for you to enter first.

Marie looks at you like you've just said something suspicious. She glances around her own space, then back at you with a raised brow.

<<speech "marie">>You like *this* room? With the busted light sconce and the “aesthetic” wall stain I've covered with a bookshelf?<</speech>>

You laugh softly.

<<speech "jaylie">>Yeah. There's not a lot here—but what is here says a lot about you. Most people in your position wouldn't be able to read let alone fill their time with philosophy, art, and history. Also your bookshelf did its job. I had no clue about the stain.<</speech>>

Marie lets out a small chuckle– a short, quick huff of air through her nose– and stares at you for a beat longer than necessary. You realize that you possibly just betrayed a piece of your 'cover' which had not been exposed before. You feel Marie's eyes look you up and down. They are not cold, just... uncertain. Then she leans back a little against the wall, her voice softening.

<<speech "marie">>Well. That's either the smoothest deflection I've heard tonight... or the first honest thing.<</speech>>

She doesn't press it. But she doesn't look away either.

She stretches her legs out a bit, brushing her fingers along the edge of the quilt like she's grounding herself in the fabric.

<<speech "marie">>That usually makes you the one who gets to decide.<</speech>>

There's a pause. Just long enough to let the implication settle.

<<speech "marie">>But if you're asking because you *actually* care what I want...<</speech>>

She glances at you, eyes sharp but not unkind.

<<speech "marie">>...then I'd say: talk a little, sit a little, maybe let the night happen slowly for once.<</speech>>

<<speech "marie">>Kallot and I… it’s complicated.<</speech>>

She lets that hang for a moment before continuing, voice quiet but clear.

<<speech "marie">>He’s not usually like that. He’s kind. Gentle. The kind of drunk who rambles about stars and apologizes for existing too much. But tonight he was…<</speech>>

She trails off, shakes her head once.

<<speech "marie">>He was angry. Dismissive. I’ve never seen him like that. I thought maybe he came to see me—but it was like I wasn’t even there.<</speech>>

Her fingers curl into the edge of the quilt again.

<<speech "marie">>I want to forgive him. I do. But I don’t understand why he was like that. Why he *chose* to be like that.<</speech>>

She finally looks at you. Really looks at you.

<<speech "marie">>You ever see someone you care about... shift into someone you don’t recognize? Just long enough to scare you?<</speech>>

  <<speech "marie">>That’s one way to put it.<</speech>>

  She draws her legs up slightly and rests her chin on her knees, eyes fixed on the opposite wall as she answers.

  <<speech "marie">>We met about a year ago. He came to the brothel drunk one night, but not... messy. Just lonely. Sad in this quiet, polite kind of way that made me feel like I couldn’t be mean to him, even if I wanted to.<</speech>>

  She gives a faint, private smile.

  <<speech "marie">>He didn’t even ask for anything. Just talked to me. Listened too. Came back the next week with a book he thought I’d like. Some old thing about myths from the Inner Isles. It had footnotes. He highlighted the wrong parts, but still—<</speech>>

  She stops herself, looking back to you.

  <<speech "marie">>Anyway. It just kind of happened. We’d talk. Sometimes he’d hold my hand. Sometimes I’d let him fall asleep on my shoulder. I don’t know what to call that, but… it was something.<</speech>>

  <<speech "marie">>No.<</speech>>

  A beat.

  <<speech "marie">>I don’t think so. Not *like that.*<</speech>>

  She folds her arms across her chest, not defensive—more like she’s holding herself in place.

  <<speech "marie">>He’s never laid a hand on me. Not when I didn't want him to. He’s the type to apologize if his elbow brushed me by mistake. That’s... who I thought he was.<</speech>>

  She exhales slowly, the breath catching on something unsaid.

  <<speech "marie">>But words? Being cold? Acting like I was a stranger? I think maybe part of him *did* want to push me away. And maybe that part didn’t care how much it would sting.<</speech>>

  She doesn't cry. She doesn’t need to.

  <<speech "marie">>Sometimes people hurt you just enough that you’ll walk away... so they won’t have to.<</speech>>

  <<speech "jaylie">>I hope this doesn't come across like I am trying to defend his actions. He hurt you and it's okay for you to feel like that, but maybe he did have something extra going on. Something that made him act out like that. I don't know him, obviously, but maybe there is more to the story that only Kallot knows.<</speech>>

  She shifts slightly on the bed, fingers fidgeting with the corner of the quilt.

  <<speech "marie">>Even when he drinks, he’s... careful. Polite, even. If anything, he’s usually the one looking scared—like he’s afraid of taking up too much space.<</speech>>

  She pauses, then adds with a lowered voice:

  <<speech "marie">>I know he’s tied up in something. Work, maybe. Maybe worse. He’s never said it outright, but I’ve heard names. Watched the way he changes when certain people come around.<</speech>>

  She meets your eyes now, steady and certain.

  <<speech "marie">>But even then, he never raised his voice. Never made me flinch. That’s why tonight was...<</speech>>

  Her voice isn’t cold—it’s honest. Worn a little thin at the edges.

  <<speech "marie">>I want to. Part of me does, anyway. The part that still believes this was... an outlier. A bad night. Something explainable.<</speech>>

  She looks down at her hands, thumbs idly tracing one another.

  <<speech "marie">>But if I open that door and he’s still wearing that same face—the one from tonight—I don’t think I could pretend it didn’t scare me.<</speech>>

  She swallows. Not hard. Not dramatic. Just a quiet moment of choosing her next words carefully.

  <<speech "marie">>I think forgiveness is easier when you understand *why* someone hurt you. When you can file it under something that makes sense. But right now... I’ve got nothing to file it under.<</speech>>

  She glances back at you with a faint, almost bitter smile.

  She looks down for a moment, pulling her knees in closer to her chest as if the question peeled away some layer of armor.

  <<speech "marie">>I was quieter, believe it or not. Not in the sulking-in-a-corner way, just... always in my head. I used to read in stairwells, write notes in margins. I wanted to be a scribe, maybe. Work in a library. Somewhere with ink stains and silence and no customers to please.<</speech>>

  A small smile tugs at her mouth—genuine, if faint.

  <<speech "marie">>I was also naïve. Thought I could change the world with enough wit and well-placed sarcasm. Thought people would see value in me just because I was smart and sharp and didn’t take shit from anyone.<</speech>>

<<speech "marie">>You’re... asking?<</speech>>

She says it softly, more observation than surprise. Her voice drops to a hush, and she leans in—just enough that you feel the warmth between you shift.

<<speech "jaylie">>Of course. I don't really know another way.<</speech>>

<<speech "marie">>Thats the most innocent thing I think I have ever heard in this room.<</speech>>

She extends one hand toward you, palm open, fingers still. Waiting.

<<speech "marie">>Go on, then. Just... be gentle.<</speech>>

You take her hand. She doesn’t pull away.

She just holds it there, eyes never leaving yours, her thumb brushing once—light as breath—against your skin.

With your other hand you reach up to her cheek and gently caress the softness of her face. As you do she leans into your hand slightly, like a cat excited to be touched. You lean towards her. She follows your lead.

When your lips melt you have a hard time thinking the best way to describe the sensation. Not explosions, not passion. The closest thing that comes to mind is contentment. You hold the position for a moment that feels much longer than it likely was, your lips locked together.

When you pull apart Marie does not look directly at you, but speaks downward, her breath shorter than you'd expect it to be.

<<speech "marie">>Lay down on your back.<</speech>>

You don't hesitate to comply.

<<speech "jaylie">>If it’s alright... I think I’d just like to lay here with you.<</speech>>

Marie doesn’t answer right away. She shifts slightly, thoughtful, and then—surprisingly—smiles.

<<speech "marie">>Yeah. That actually sounds... really nice.<</speech>>

She scoots back and folds the blanket down beside her. The gesture is plain, but there’s something careful in it. She’s not offering a show. She’s offering *space*.

<<speech "marie">>Just don’t snore. I’ve already had enough surprises for one night.<</speech>>

You both laugh, quiet and close.
