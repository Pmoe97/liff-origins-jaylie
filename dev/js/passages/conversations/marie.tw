    You approach the blonde girl, who had thrown the horseshoe at the man out side. She turns half a face towards you as you sit on the couch next to her. Her face is soft, but she is obviously annoyed.
    <<speech "jaylie">> Hey there. I'm Jaylie.<</speech>>
    <<speech "marie">> Marie.<</speech>>
    <<speech "jaylie">> How are you doing?<</speech>>
    <<speech "marie">> Oh just wonderful. This night is going so well. Can't you tell?<</speech>>
    You frown at her sarcasm. She isn't looking at you, but you felt her eyes roll.

    You try softening your tone, hoping to break through whatever storm is brewing behind her eyes.

    <<speech "jaylie">>Looks like you've had a rough night.<</speech>>
    <<speech "marie">>Is it the scowl, the clenched jaw, or the ‘go away’ energy that gave it away?<</speech>>

    She exhales through her nose. Not quite a laugh, not quite a sigh.

    <<speech "marie">>Either way, ten points to you for perception.<</speech>>

    You glance at her, then at the space between you both. It stretches like a wall you can’t climb.

    <<speech "jaylie">>You know, if it helps, you can talk to me about what happened. I've been told I can be a good listener.<</speech>>

    Marie doesn’t answer at first. Just blinks slowly, then tilts her head ever so slightly in your direction.

    <<speech "marie">>I don't need to talk about it. Especially to strangers who sit next to me like I’m a stray cat that needs saving.<</speech>>

    Obviously not getting anywhere, with her you get up to leave.
    <<speech "jaylie">>I'm gonna go. I hope your night gets a little better.<</speech>>
    
    You turn to leave and make it only a step before you feel a hand on your hand, soft and warm. You turn and look back at the girl. Her eyes meet yours for the first time.

    <<speech "marie">>I'm sorry, Jaylie. That's not who I am. That man just really brought the worst out of me. Think we can start again?<</speech>>

    You hesitate for a brief moment, then smile and nod at her. She gently pulls your hand, guiding you back to the couch.

    <<speech "marie">>Thank you for trying to check on me.<</speech>>

    She smiles. It looks a little forced, but you can tell she is genuinely trying.
