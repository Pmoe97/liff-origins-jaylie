Darian leans back a little, glancing around the room with something like fondness. Not for the building, necessarily—but for the people moving within it.

<<speech "darian">>A few years, give or take. I wasn't planning to stay this long, but... the place has a way of pulling you in.<</speech>>

He shrugs, though there's more weight behind it than he lets on.

<<speech "darian">>It's not the walls, it's the people. We look after each other. You don't find that everywhere. Especially not in this line of work.<</speech>>

He looks at you, warm but steady.

<<speech "darian">>You learn a lot about someone when you're the reason they let their guard down. It's not always pretty. But sometimes... sometimes it's beautiful.<</speech>>

Darian's eyebrows lift slightly, then settle into a thoughtful expression. He doesn't laugh it off or dodge—it's clear he's been asked this before.

<<speech "darian">>Some nights more than others.<</speech>>

He smiles—genuine, not forced.

<<speech "darian">>I won't pretend every moment is fulfilling. But I meet people. I learn from them. Sometimes I help them feel human again, even if just for a little while. That means something to me.<</speech>>

His fingers absentmindedly trace the edge of a nearby glass, thoughtful.

<<speech "darian">>The job isn't really about what we do. It's about what people leave with. And when I get that part right... yeah. I like it.<</speech>>

Darian glances down at his wrist like he forgot it was even there. His fingers graze the band slowly, almost unconsciously.

<<speech "darian">>It was a gift. From someone important.<</speech>>

He doesn't elaborate, not right away. His eyes lose focus for a moment—caught somewhere between memory and the present.

<<speech "darian">>I've worn it every day since they gave it to me. It's held up surprisingly well... not unlike the person who made it.<</speech>>

There's a small pause—long enough for you to sense he's choosing what *not* to say.

<<speech "darian">>Maybe I'll tell you more about it sometime. If the night keeps going like this.<</speech>>

He offers a smile—not flirtatious this time, just sincere.

Darian chuckles softly.

<<speech "darian">>You asking because you want a drink, or because you want an excuse to talk to me longer?<</speech>>

Before you can answer, he lifts a hand to catch Bert's attention.

<<speech "darian">>Bert, can we get something a little warm but not too strong? Something for thinking, not forgetting.<</speech>>

Bert grunts from the far end of the bar, already reaching for bottles.

<<speech "bert">>So... not the ‘Red Mercy,' then. Got it.<</speech>>

Darian leans in slightly, lowering his voice.

<<speech "darian">>He pretends to be grumpy, but he's one of the kindest souls in this place. That drink you're about to get? He only makes it for people he actually likes.<</speech>>

He straightens as Bert slides a glass across the counter. The liquid inside glows a soft amber, curling with steam.

<<speech "darian">>Try that. It's got a name, but I like calling it 'Second Wind.' Makes you feel like the night's still got promise.<</speech>>

You lift the glass and breathe in.

The aroma is warm and spiced—notes of orange peel, clove, and something almost floral beneath the heat. When you take a sip, it's smoother than you expected. The burn is soft, the flavor deep. It blooms across your tongue like dusk settling into firelight.

It doesn't dull your senses. It *clarifies* them.

You lower the glass, exhaling slow.

<<speech "jaylie">>That's... actually perfect.<</speech>>

Darian smiles. Not smug. Just pleased.

<<speech "darian">>I thought you might say that.<</speech>>

Darian pauses, the question catching him mid-thought. He laughs softly—but there's a heaviness under it, like the air changes just a little.

<<speech "darian">>Yeah... I was. Before all this.<</speech>>

He glances down at his hands, flexing his fingers like they still remember a different rhythm.

<<speech "darian">>I was trained in opera. Classical stuff. Big stages, packed halls, fancy suits with too much starch in the collars.<</speech>>

His eyes go distant for a moment.

<<speech "darian">>I used to love it. Music made sense in ways life didn't. I could climb an aria like a staircase and feel like I'd gone somewhere worth arriving.<</speech>>

A quiet beat.

<<speech "darian">>But that was before. Before a lot of things changed.<</speech>>

He doesn't say more—not here, not yet—but you can tell the story's still close behind his smile.

<<speech "darian">>Now I hum to keep pieces of it close. Not for performance. Just... for me.<</speech>>

<<speech "darian">>Not quite. Each host decorates their own. Some lean decadent. Others lean... chaotic.<</speech>>

He runs a hand along one of the thick curtains.

<<speech "darian">>These started as an attempt to make the place feel more like a theater. Turns out, they're also pretty good at keeping sound in. Which is useful, apparently, because not all the customers enjoy spontaneous arias through the walls.<</speech>>

He laughs softly, then looks at you with just a hint of that stage-smile beneath the surface.

You both laugh for a moment before the room goes quiet again. The walls absorbing the laughs like they were hungry for it. Darian speaks again through a half-hearted smile.

<<speech "darian">>But in truth? It's been a long night. Not bad. Just... long. The kind that leaves you a little quiet inside.<</speech>>

He exhales gently, like saying that out loud takes some of the weight off.

    <<speech "darian">>That's not a question.<</speech>>

    <<speech "jaylie">>Alright, fine. Who gave you the bracelet?<</speech>>

    He runs his thumb over the clasp once. Slowly.

    <<speech "darian">>My sister. The one person who knew me before the stage, before the noise. She made it by hand when we were younger. Said I needed something to wear that wasn't an act.<</speech>>

    A beat.

    <<speech "darian">>I don't take it off. Not ever.<</speech>>

    He lets that linger, then leans slightly closer—eyes on you now, not the bracelet.

    You freeze.

    It isn't accusation. It's observation. Quiet. Precise.

    <<speech "darian">>You carry yourself like a noble, but you look at people like you're still hoping you can be one of them. That's not common. Especially not in this city.<</speech>>

    You open your mouth, but the words come slower than you expect.

    <<speech "jaylie">>You're sharp. I am a noble. I don't get out often enough because of it, so moments like this are special to me. I often wish I was on this side of that wall. Being born never felt much like the gift people make it out to be.<</speech>>

    Darian's voice softens.

    <<speech "darian">>Keep it up then noble-girl. Perhaps you'll be a 'noble of the people' one day. Gods know we don't have enough of those. Common folk starve while the rich can eat themselves to bursting.<</speech>>

    Darian leans back against the curtain-lined wall, head tilted, gaze drifting.

    <<speech "darian">>Lonely. But rewarding. Like lighting candles in the dark and hoping someone out there is warmed by the glow.<</speech>>

    He breathes out through his nose, not quite a sigh.

    <<speech "darian">>For a while, my sister traveled with me. She was the pragmatic one. Knew when to rest. Knew when I was pushing too hard. She got sick, though. Had to settle. I stayed close when I could... but life pulls in too many directions.<</speech>>

    He doesn't say the rest right away. He just looks down at his hands.

    <<speech "darian">>When she passed, I didn't even know until days after. No final song. No goodbye. Just... silence. And after that, the stage never felt like it had room for me anymore.<</speech>>

    He looks solemn for a moment before looking back at you.

    <<speech "darian">>Your turn.<</speech>>

    He looks at you now, not accusing, but searching.

    <<speech "darian">>Was it your mother or father?<</speech>>

    You blink.

    <<speech "jaylie">>What?<</speech>>

    <<speech "darian">>One of them died. I can tell. You speak like someone who carries the absence of a parent like a second name.<</speech>>

    <<speech "jaylie">>My mother. She died giving birth to me.<</speech>>

    He nods slowly. Not with pity—just understanding.

    <<speech "darian">>Because there's no applause in grief. And no stage that wants a broken voice.<</speech>>

    He shifts, hands clasped loosely in his lap.

    <<speech "darian">>After my sister passed, I couldn't sing without feeling like the echo was chasing me. I tried. Gods, I tried. But every theater felt too big. Too empty.<</speech>>

    His voice lowers.

    <<speech "darian">>So I came here. Not because I wanted to be touched, or paid, or even needed... but because I wanted to disappear into something smaller. Something real. Where no one claps when you bleed well.<</speech>>

    He pauses, then looks around the room—not wistfully, but with something close to gratitude.

    <<speech "darian">>Strange thing is... I didn't disappear. I just stopped performing. And somewhere in the quiet, I started to feel like I belonged again.<</speech>>

    <<speech "darian">>The others here—Adda, Bert, Marie... they became something like family. They don't need me to dazzle. They just need me to show up. And I can do that.<</speech>>

    He lets the silence settle. Then:

    <<speech "darian">>Now it's my turn...Why did *you* come here tonight?<</speech>>

    You falter—not because you don't know, but because no one's asked it quite like that.

    <<speech "jaylie">>Honestly? I'm not sure. I went out tonight because I wanted to drink.<</speech>>

    Darian doesn't let that sit.

    <<speech "darian">>What were you trying to drown?<</speech>>

    You hesitate, gaze falling.

    <<speech "jaylie">>It's my birthday.<</speech>>

    He leans forward, elbows on knees.

    <<speech "darian">>I fell for duets, for glances across the wings, for the way some people touched your hand like it was the first time <strong>every</strong>time. But the stage is a mirror, not a home. Love there doesn't last—it just echoes.<</speech>>

    His smile falters, just slightly.

    <<speech "darian">>Still, I'd be lying if I said I didn't chase it. And some of those moments? They were real. Even if they didn't survive the final bow.<</speech>>

    He leans back, the curtain behind him pressing in like quiet velvet.

    <<speech "darian">>I remember it fondly. The stages. The travel. The music. The way it all felt like I was part of something larger than myself.<</speech>>

    A pause.

    <<speech "darian">>But missing it... that would mean wanting it back. And I know what it would cost to have that again.<</speech>>

    He taps the bracelet lightly with one finger.

    <<speech "darian">>I don't need the stage. I needed her. The rest was just echo.<</speech>>

    He glances at you—not fragile, but stripped down to something real.

    <<speech "darian">>Oh I remember. Once after a show I found myself not quite able to go to sleep, so I went out and explored the city. The theater I had been in, I learned, was brand new because the old one in the city had burned down. Rather than build on top of the ashes, the town left the old theater still standing. I made a mission of finding it.<</speech>>

    He smiles faintly, the memory distant but polished.

    <<speech "darian">>I found the old theater a few blocks away and was terrified upon my approach because I heard a truly haunting voice coming from within. I've no clue what came over me because despite thinking it must be haunted I was drawn inside like a sailor to a siren. There was no vengeful spirit though, just a girl standing on the remnants of the old stage, singing her heart out to an empty theater, now an audience of one. Her voice cracked halfway through, and she laughed at herself. Kept singing anyway. That was years ago. I never learned her name. But I still remember how the sound carried through the rain.<</speech>>

    He turns to you now—softer, but not fragile.

    <<speech "darian">>What about you? What moment do you carry around when the world's too loud?<</speech>>

    You breathe in, slow. A flicker of something rises—small, strange, but real.

    <<speech "jaylie">>There's a well behind the old barracks. When I was a child, I used to sit there and listen to the wind echo down the stone. It sounded like a voice trying to remember a song it had almost forgotten.<</speech>>

    Darian's gaze doesn't waver.

    <<speech "darian">>Maybe that's what we are, then. Songs trying to remember themselves.<</speech>>
