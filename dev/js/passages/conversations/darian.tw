<<append "#convoBox">>
<<speech "jaylie">>So how long have you worked here?<</speech>>

Darian leans back a little, glancing around the room with something like fondness. Not for the building, necessarily—but for the people moving within it.

<<speech "darian">>A few years, give or take. I wasn’t planning to stay this long, but... the place has a way of pulling you in.<</speech>>

He shrugs, though there’s more weight behind it than he lets on.

<<speech "darian">>It’s not the walls, it’s the people. We look after each other. You don’t find that everywhere. Especially not in this line of work.<</speech>>

He looks at you, warm but steady.

<<speech "darian">>You learn a lot about someone when you're the reason they let their guard down. It’s not always pretty. But sometimes... sometimes it’s beautiful.<</speech>>

<<widget "Darian_DoYouLikeJob">>
<<append "#convoBox">>
<<speech "jaylie">>Do you actually enjoy this job?<</speech>>

Darian’s eyebrows lift slightly, then settle into a thoughtful expression. He doesn’t laugh it off or dodge—it’s clear he’s been asked this before.

<<speech "darian">>Some nights more than others.<</speech>>

He smiles—genuine, not forced.

<<speech "darian">>I won't pretend every moment is fulfilling. But I meet people. I learn from them. Sometimes I help them feel human again, even if just for a little while. That means something to me.<</speech>>

His fingers absentmindedly trace the edge of a nearby glass, thoughtful.

<<speech "darian">>The job isn’t really about what we do. It’s about what people leave with. And when I get that part right... yeah. I like it.<</speech>>

<<widget "Darian_Bracelet">>
<<append "#convoBox">>
<<speech "jaylie">>That bracelet you're wearing... where did it come from?<</speech>>

Darian glances down at his wrist like he forgot it was even there. His fingers graze the band slowly, almost unconsciously.

<<speech "darian">>It was a gift. From someone important.<</speech>>

He doesn’t elaborate, not right away. His eyes lose focus for a moment—caught somewhere between memory and the present.

<<speech "darian">>I’ve worn it every day since they gave it to me. It’s held up surprisingly well... not unlike the person who made it.<</speech>>

There’s a small pause—long enough for you to sense he’s choosing what *not* to say.

<<speech "darian">>Maybe I’ll tell you more about it sometime. If the night keeps going like this.<</speech>>

He offers a smile—not flirtatious this time, just sincere.

:: Darian_GetDrink [widget]
<<widget "Darian_GetDrink">>
<<append "#convoBox">>
<<speech "jaylie">>Do you think you could help me get a drink?<</speech>>

Darian chuckles softly.

<<speech "darian">>You asking because you want a drink, or because you want an excuse to talk to me longer?<</speech>>

Before you can answer, he lifts a hand to catch Bert’s attention.

<<speech "darian">>Bert, can we get something a little warm but not too strong? Something for thinking, not forgetting.<</speech>>

Bert grunts from the far end of the bar, already reaching for bottles.

<<speech "bert">>So... not the ‘Red Mercy,’ then. Got it.<</speech>>

Darian leans in slightly, lowering his voice.

<<speech "darian">>He pretends to be grumpy, but he’s one of the kindest souls in this place. That drink you’re about to get? He only makes it for people he actually likes.<</speech>>

He straightens as Bert slides a glass across the counter. The liquid inside glows a soft amber, curling with steam.

<<speech "darian">>Try that. It’s got a name, but I like calling it 'Second Wind.' Makes you feel like the night’s still got promise.<</speech>>

You lift the glass and breathe in.

The aroma is warm and spiced—notes of orange peel, clove, and something almost floral beneath the heat. When you take a sip, it’s smoother than you expected. The burn is soft, the flavor deep. It blooms across your tongue like dusk settling into firelight.

It doesn’t dull your senses. It *clarifies* them.

You lower the glass, exhaling slow.

<<speech "jaylie">>That’s... actually perfect.<</speech>>

Darian smiles. Not smug. Just pleased.

<<speech "darian">>I thought you might say that.<</speech>>

<<widget "Darian_Humming">>
<<append "#convoBox">>
<<speech "jaylie">>You hum a lot. Were you a musician once?<</speech>>

Darian pauses, the question catching him mid-thought. He laughs softly—but there's a heaviness under it, like the air changes just a little.

<<speech "darian">>Yeah... I was. Before all this.<</speech>>

He glances down at his hands, flexing his fingers like they still remember a different rhythm.

<<speech "darian">>I was trained in opera. Classical stuff. Big stages, packed halls, fancy suits with too much starch in the collars.<</speech>>

His eyes go distant for a moment.

<<speech "darian">>I used to love it. Music made sense in ways life didn’t. I could climb an aria like a staircase and feel like I’d gone somewhere worth arriving.<</speech>>

A quiet beat.

<<speech "darian">>But that was before. Before a lot of things changed.<</speech>>

He doesn’t say more—not here, not yet—but you can tell the story’s still close behind his smile.

<<speech "darian">>Now I hum to keep pieces of it close. Not for performance. Just... for me.<</speech>>

<<speech "jaylie">>I just want to get to know you better.<</speech>>

Darian tilts his head, his expression unreadable for a moment—thoughtful, maybe a little surprised. Then he smiles, slow and sincere.

<<speech "darian">>That’s not something I hear very often. At least not from people who mean it.<</speech>>

He leans against the bar, arms folded lightly.

<<speech "darian">>Alright, then. Let’s talk. But fair warning—I'm not always the easiest book to read.<</speech>>

<<speech "jaylie">>Do you think we could go somewhere more private?<</speech>>

Darian doesn't answer immediately. His gaze lingers on you a moment longer than usual, soft but searching.

<<speech "darian">>We could. If that’s really what you want.<</speech>>

His voice isn’t challenging—it’s careful, like he wants to be sure you're not asking just to fill the space between you.

<<speech "darian">>The hallway upstairs is quiet this time of night. My room’s at the far end. No one will bother us there.<</speech>>

He steps forward, extending a hand—not dramatic, not performative. Just steady.

<<speech "darian">>Come on. I’ll walk with you.<</speech>>

<<speech "jaylie">>I hope you don't mind, I think I am going to explore the parlor a bit more.<</speech>>

Darian nods, easy and warm.

<<speech "darian">>Of course. The night’s still young—plenty of stories left to find.<</speech>>

He gives a small bow of the head and gestures subtly back toward the center of the lounge.

<<speech "darian">>If you change your mind... you know where to find me.<</speech>>
