  Bert does not break eye contact, nor does he hesiate for a moment in his polishing of the glass in his hand.
  <<speech "bert">>Unfortunately Miss, that’s not on the menu.<</speech>>

  <<speech "jaylie">>I don't usually have such a selection to drink from. I'm not even sure what to ask for.<</speech>>
  Bert raises an eyebrow at you as if waiting for you to get the the point of your request.
  <<speech "jaylie">> Would you mind making something special for me? I'll trust your judgement.<</speech>>
  <<speech "bert">> Something special you say? I would be delighted to.<</speech>>
    With a quick flourish of his arms, a shining metal cup is produced from under the counter, catching the glow of the hanging lanterns as if it had been waiting for just this moment. Bert runs a cloth over it with meticulous care, inspecting it like a jeweler inspecting a rare gem.

  <<speech "bert">>You strike me as someone with fire in her spirit, but a touch of sadness behind the eyes. Let’s see if we can match that with something... complicated.<</speech>>

  He turns to the shelf behind him, fingers ghosting over rows of vividly colored bottles, some of which emit a faint shimmer or trace of smoke within their glass. He selects four: 
    -A bottle of *Whisperleaf Gin*—a pale green spirit known for its calming aftertaste
    - *Ashplum Cordial*—a dark, bitter-sweet reduction brewed in volcanic soil, 
    -A vial of *Feyroot Elixir*—glowing faintly pink and said to react to emotion, 
    -A twist-top jar of crushed *Iceblossom Petals*—frosted over like snowflakes.

  Bert begins to mix. 

  He measures with an instinctual confidence, pouring the gin in first—a sharp, cool base that fogs the metal cup. The cordial follows, swirling through like a bloodstain in silver. The elixir is added last, just a drop, but as it hits the mix, you swear the entire cup glows for a brief moment.

  <<speech "bert">>And now for the ice...<</speech>>

  He reaches into a chilled drawer and pulls out a single crystalline sphere—transparent, but with what looks like a tiny storm cloud suspended in its center. He cracks it gently against the bar’s edge, letting the shards fall like glass snow into the cup. A cover is placed over the top, of the metal cup and Bert quickly begins to shake it with a certain measure and efficiency.

  After a moment, one of Bert's hands reaches from above and pulls down a conical, crystal glass. He sets the glass on its edge and gives it a spin. The glass twirls rapidly in place, balancing in such a way that almost defies reason.

  Quickly bert removes the lid of the metal container and pours into the glass as it spins. The contents create a spiral of green and blue which quickly meld together in a vibrant color reminiscent of a dark sea.

  Bert finishes by garnishing the rim with a single frozen petal and a twist of a dark citrus rind, its scent a faint mix of orange and something darker, more elusive.

  <<speech "bert">>Here we are madam. I call it a *Storm of Grace.* Because it looks delicate, tastes bold, and lingers longer than it should. Like some people.<</speech>>

  He slides the drink towards you and watches you closely for a moment, awaiting your reaction.

  You bring the glass to your lips. Inhaling for a moment, you inhale an exciting aroma, sweet and light. You sip.

  <<speech "jaylie">>Wow. This is... incredible!<</speech>>
  
  The bartender smiles, just a hint of pride, gone before you were sure you actually saw it. He nods ever so slightly.

  <<speech "bert">> Please enjoy Miss. This one is on the house, compliments of the Madam.<</speech>>
  
  You glance over to Adda, watching from now so far away. You smile, raise your glass to her. She smiles and nods before turning her attention back to the rest of the parlor.

  His avoidance of his personal life as a topic is palpable. You decide to drop the subject.
