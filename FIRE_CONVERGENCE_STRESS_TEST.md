# FireConvergence - Node Network System Stress Test

## Overview

FireConvergence is a comprehensive stress test implementation for the NodeMapSystem that creates a dynamic, randomized orphanage fire rescue scenario. This event pushes the node network system to its limits with complex mechanics, real-time progression, and sophisticated state management.

## üî• Event Description

You are thrust into a burning orphanage during a lightning storm. The building is collapsing, children are trapped, and you have limited time and breath to rescue them before the structure fails completely. This scenario tests every aspect of the node network system through:

- **Dynamic randomization** of room layouts, item spawns, and child locations
- **Real-time fire progression** that spreads through connected nodes
- **Breath management system** with environmental hazards
- **Structural collapse mechanics** that block routes over time
- **Multiple escape routes** with different requirements
- **Complex condition evaluation** for dynamic gameplay

## üéØ Stress Test Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Test dynamic node modification** - Nodes change properties in real-time
2. **Validate condition system** - Complex state-based node behavior
3. **Stress connection management** - Routes open/close dynamically
4. **Performance under load** - Continuous updates and calculations
5. **Event system integration** - Complex scripted interactions

### Secondary Goals
1. **UI responsiveness** during intensive operations
2. **Memory management** with frequent state changes
3. **Error handling** under extreme conditions
4. **Scalability** with complex node networks
5. **Integration testing** between all system components

- **Critical Threshold**: 20 points (visual warning)

### Fire Progression
- **Initial Fire**: Starts at entrance and main hallway
- **Spread Pattern**: Radial expansion through connections
- **Intensity Levels**: Smoke (1) ‚Üí Flames (2) ‚Üí Inferno (3) ‚Üí Collapsed (4)
- **Dynamic Effects**: Increases breath cost and blocks movement

### Structural Integrity
- **Starting Integrity**: 100%
- **Decay Rate**: Based on total fire damage
- **Collapse Threshold**: 20% (game over)
- **Dynamic Blocking**: Stairs collapse at 50% integrity

### Item System
- **Wet Cloth**: Reduces breath cost in smoky areas
- **Key Ring**: Unlocks locked doors and closets
- **Rope**: Enables window escape route
- **Healing Potion**: Restores 20 breath points
- **Lantern**: Improves visibility (cosmetic)

### Child Rescue
- **4 Children**: Zan, Mira, Tom, Sara
- **Random Placement**: Probability-based room assignment
- **Search Mechanic**: Must interact with rooms to find children
- **Rescue Requirement**: Need at least 1 child to escape

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Dynamic Node Modification
```javascript
// Nodes change properties based on game state
node.metadata.fireIntensity += spreadAmount;
node.metadata.breathCost = Math.floor(fireIntensity);
node.walkable = structuralIntegrity > collapseThreshold;
```

### Condition Evaluation
```javascript
// Complex state-based conditions
"condition": "State.variables.fireConvergence.timeElapsed > 300"
"condition": "!State.variables.fireConvergence.hasKeys"
"condition": "State.variables.fireConvergence.structuralIntegrity < 50"
```

### Real-time Updates
```javascript
// Continuous system updates
updateInterval = setInterval(() => {
    updateBreath();
    updateFireProgression();
    updateStructuralIntegrity();
    checkGameConditions();
    nodeMapSystem.updateDynamicNodes();
}, 1000);
```

### Performance Monitoring
```javascript
// Stress test metrics tracking
performanceStats = {
    dynamicUpdates: 0,
    conditionChecks: 0,
    eventTriggers: 0,
    updateRate: 0
